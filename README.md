This is an app that i develop during Advance Mobile App Development for my final project.

The app is about Genshin Impact that serves as a companion tool for players of the popular action role-playing game called Genshin Impact. Genshin Impact is developed by miHoYo and is available on various platforms, including PC, PlayStation, and mobile devices.

The Genshin Guide app provides players with a range of features and functions to enhance their gaming experience. Here are some key aspects of the app:

Character and Weapon Database: The app includes a comprehensive database that provides detailed information about all the playable characters and weapons available in the game. Players can browse through character profiles, check their stats, abilities, and talents, as well as explore different weapon options and their attributes.

Interactive Map: The app offers an interactive map of the in-game world of Teyvat. Players can use this map to discover and mark locations of interest, such as resource nodes, teleportation points, chests, puzzles, and other important landmarks. It helps players navigate the vast world and plan their exploration effectively.
